            Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown
            regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all
            began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3
            monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to
            help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking
            him to sign your favorite book.</p>

                    extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is
                    the main state you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had
                    best be prepared for an arduous trek.</p>
                <p class="places__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on
                    US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab
                    a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.
                </p>

                <p class="places__paragraph">There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New
                    Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled
                    than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
                <p class="places__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick
                    up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the
                    world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a
                    pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be
                    confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes
                    when pitching a tent.

                <p class="places__paragraph">Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several other
                    reasons for going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls
                    the World,” has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.</p>
                <p class="places__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary
                    means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless
                    dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure.
                    Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

                    can be from time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While
                    it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln
                    during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie,
                    huh?)</p>
                <p class="places__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed,
                    can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company.
                    Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an
                    Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra
                    eerie time!

                <p class="places__paragraph">From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of Cleveland,
                    Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North
                    America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However,
                    earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest
                    and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will
                    presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it).
                    Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike
                    ride!</p>
